# bZimbra - A Zimbra Suitecrm pseudo-module

## Installation

This is not a regular Suitecrm module.
We are making it public so that it can be useful for others.

However there are not official instructions on how to install it.
This is due to be so custom that it's going to be barely useful for
others unless you start a similar project from scratch.

So... do not ask for installation instructions on issues.

Thank you!

## Custom modules

This module is intended to work with some of our custom Suitecrm modules:

- `btc_Zimbra_Accounts`
- `btc_bMail`

which have not made public.

## Features

- Fetch Zimbra domain aggregated maximum quota
- Fetch Zimbra domain aggregated used quota
- Fetch Zimbra accounts

and some more features.
